    "description": "The certificate Program in Engineering and Management Systems (EMS) provides students with tools for the complex decision-making problems that arise in engineering, the sciences, and management. The program offers a coherent, integrated set of core courses that are based on analytic methods, with applications in the planning and control of complex systems required by a modern technological society. Emphasis is placed on rigorous modeling and analysis, taking advantage of the vast flow of data and ubiquitous computing power available today. The EMS certificate program complements the certificate programs in applications of computing, applied and computational mathematics, and finance.",
