  "explanation": "The Department of French and Italian offers four tracks for concentrators and a flexible, individualized approach to course planning. Students either pursue a course of study entirely in French or Italian, or combine this specialization with another language, academic discipline, or creative art. FIT encourages innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of the Italian, French, and francophone worlds, tailored to the unique academic and professional interests of students. For examples of the kinds of topics students in FIT have explored in their Senior Thesis, see the list of titles below.",

Students primarily interested in culture and civilization have written on art, on political and economic issues, on education, and on a variety of social questions. For students following tracks 2, 3, and 4, joint supervision may be arranged. The senior thesis is a major commitment of a student's time and energy, and the most important yardstick for choosing a topic is willingness to spend many hours immersed in that particular set of texts or problems.\n\nConcentrators in French and/or Italian who are also earning certificates should consult with their advisers about selecting a suitable thesis topic. The senior thesis may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the relevant language must be provided.
