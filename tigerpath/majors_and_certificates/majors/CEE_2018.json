Particular emphasis is given to the design of these structures to resist earthquake and wind loads. The program is designed to meet the needs of students who are interested in continuing to advanced graduate studies or who plan to go into engineering practice and consulting. This track is accredited by the Engineering Commission of ABET (www.abet.org) under the program in Civil Engineering. Its basic aim is the preparation of flexible and innovative graduates who can address the novel problems of modern engineering. Students in this program have the chance to interact directly with some of the best design and consulting companies in structural engineering.",
