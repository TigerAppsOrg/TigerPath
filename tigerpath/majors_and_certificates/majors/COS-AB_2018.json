  "description": "Computer science concentrators must take 8 departmental courses (departmentals) and do independent work. The minimum amount of independent work depends on whether you are an AB candidate (4 semesters minimum) or a BSE candidate (1 semester minimum). Departmental courses are any computer science course at the 300 or 400 level (except 397, 398, 497 and 498) and a specific set of courses in other departments (enumerated below). There is also a distribution requirement within the 8 departmental courses: you must take at least 2 Systems departmentals, at least 2 Theory departmentals, and at least 2 Applications departmentals. (Notice that leaves you 6 departmentals that are constrained and 2 departmentals that are unconstrained.)\n\nBSE candidates do independent work by signing up for COS 397 or 398 in the junior year, or COS 497 or 498 in the senior year. You encouraged to do more than one semester of independent work; the second semester of independent work may be counted as a departmental.\n\nAB candidates do 2 one-semester junior independent work projects and a full year senior thesis. Numbered courses are not used to designate AB independent work.",

These eight courses must include two each from the three main areas.\n\nAny computer science (COS) course at the 300 or 400 level (except independent work) counts as a computer science departmental. In addition, some graduate COS courses (500-level) count as undergraduate departmentals (COS 551, COS 534), depending on their content and structure. (Please ask if you need to use a graduate course as a departmental). However, graduate courses rarely count as special \"tracked\" departmentals (see the list below for the few exceptions).\n\nIn addition, any 300- or 400- level Math or ELE or Physics or ORF course that does not duplicate COS content, Philosophy 312, MAE 345, CHM 303(CHM 303 is now renumbered to CHM 301 as of 8/27/2018), ECO 312, MOL 437/NEU 437, NEU 330, MUS 315, and ECO 326 – Economics of the Internet count as departmentals. On occasion, special courses with computational content from other departments may fall in to this category. Note that it is very, very, very rare for courses outside the computer science department that are not cross-listed with the computer science department to count as track-specific (ie: Theory/Systems/Applications) departmentals. Hence, in general, you will not be able to count more than 2 courses outside of the computer science department as COS departmentals.\n\nSome regular courses are COS departmentals but do not count in any specific track, such as COS 351 \"Information technology and public policy\". COS 495, Special Topics, is a departmental but may be associated with different tracks (or no track) depending on content. Other one-time courses may also be departmentals and may count in one of the tracks depending on level and content.

A junior project normally involves the study and solution of specific problems, often associated with a research project. It may require a significant programming effort, a theoretical study involving the design and analysis of algorithms, or an applications problem in some other field. The results of these efforts must be presented in two written reports and posters that correspond to the work undertaken in each of the terms. The senior thesis may be a study in greater depth of one of the subjects considered in junior independent work, or it may deal with another aspect of computer science and its application.\n\nIndependent work is one of the unique features of a Princeton education. Independent projects typically arise either from an idea that excites you or from an idea put forth by a professor in the department. The department maintains a wiki of faculty research interests. This list is a good place to start in looking for a project or advisor. There is also some general advice on finding a topic, an adviser, and a successful outcome here.\n\nOnce you have a project, get a form (located on the bulletin board outside the Computer Science undergraduate office) and sign it along with your advisor to let us know what you'll be doing. Your project is then between you and your advisor, but there is always a COS Independent Work Coordinator who coordinates all independent work, and schedules public talks, checkpoints, and other requirements.\n\nIt is possible to do a project with a faculty member in another department if you have the approval of the Independent Work Coordinator.",
