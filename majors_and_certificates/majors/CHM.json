The Junior Colloquium: One evening each week throughout the fall term, talks will be given by faculty members on topics not normally included in coursework. Junior chemistry concentrators and early concentrators are required to attend these sessions.\n2. Reading Groups:  Juniors will be assigned to one of several reading groups. Over the course of the semester, every group will meet with three separate instructors, one for each of three four-week reading periods. Reading group instructors will utilize current chemical literature to introduce novel research and the mechanics of scientific writing. At the end of each reading period, students will submit a critical analysis of a research article.\nReading group advisers are selected by the Junior Colloquia chairperson to give the student a broad sampling of faculty interests. The student's final term grade is calculated by the departmental representative using the grades on the three papers plus the individual's record of attendance at the evening colloquia.\nSecond-term program:\nEach student will select a faculty adviser for spring independent work by the start of the spring semester. The student will meet regularly with the faculty adviser during the semester. At the end of the term, the student will submit a research proposal for the senior thesis. The student will summarize any preliminary experimental results. A student's final term grade is determined by the departmental representative in conjunction with the faculty adviser's evaluation.",
