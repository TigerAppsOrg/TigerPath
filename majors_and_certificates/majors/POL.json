The Track also encompasses courses in international relations and comparative politics focusing on human rights, ethnic conflict, and social movements. This Track is suitable for students interested in all Politics subfields, including Political Theory, American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Political Economy, and Methods. Currently, the widest array of courses in the Track is available in the subfield of American Politics. As with other Department Tracks, students enrolled in the Race and Identity Track must still fulfill other requirements for Politics concentrators, including the Distribution requirement (a primary field, a secondary field, and a tertiary field). A single course can simultaneously satisfy a Distribution requirement and count towards the Track.",
